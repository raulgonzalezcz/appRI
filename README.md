# Basic Search Engine using Cranfield Collection
Example of a basic serach engine using Cranfield Collection. According to some topics of Information Retrieval, we apply precision/recall, vector model to apply weight (TF-IDF) and similarity (Dot product) schemes.

As additionals features, we implement feedback techinque to improve our results and alert some actions to the user.

The project was developed through Javascript, HTML, CSS and node.js to use some modules such as mysql-connector and socket.io

## Usage
In this application, the server must be active and the user opens index.html file in a browser (preferably Chrome or Firefox). Then a query is selected and the search engine will try to find the most similar documents.

It is neccesary to have the corresponding tables in MySQL (we use a vector model RDBMS) to let the server perform the queries from the user.

## Programming language
